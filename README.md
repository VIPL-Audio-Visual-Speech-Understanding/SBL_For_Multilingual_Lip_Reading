# SBL_For_Multilingual_Lip_Reading
This is a project for multilingual lip reading with synchronous bidirectional learning.

When we only use phonemes as decoding units on LRW, we will get about 76.22% (WER/Acc) performance.
When we only use phonemes as decoding units on LRW-1000, we will get about 41.83% (WER/Acc) performance.
